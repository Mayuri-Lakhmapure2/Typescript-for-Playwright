DAY 3 – TYPESCRIPT FOR PLAYWRIGHT & CYPRESS

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JAVASCRIPT AND TYPESCRIPT

JavaScript is a dynamically typed programming language.
In JavaScript, variable types are checked at runtime.

TypeScript is a statically typed programming language.
In TypeScript, variable types are checked at compile time.

TYPE SAFETY

Type safety ensures that variables are used according to their defined data types.
It helps to catch errors at compile time and improves code reliability and maintainability.

DATA TYPES IN TYPESCRIPT

A data type defines the type of value a variable can store.

TYPE ANNOTATIONS AND TYPE INFERENCE

Type Annotation:
Explicitly specifying the data type of a variable.

Example:
let age: number = 25;

Type Inference:
TypeScript automatically determines the data type based on the assigned value.

Example:
let name = "Mayuri";

TYPES OF DATA TYPES IN TYPESCRIPT

Data types in TypeScript are classified into two types:

Primitive Data Types

Non-Primitive Data Types

PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES

number
Used to represent numeric values.

Example:
let score: number = 90;

string
Used to represent text values.

Example:
let username: string = "Admin";

boolean
Used to represent true or false values.

Example:
let isActive: boolean = true;

null
Represents an intentional absence of value.

Example:
let result: null = null;

undefined
Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

Example:
let data: undefined;

any
Allows a variable to store any type of value.
It disables type checking and should be avoided when possible.

Example:
let value: any = 10;

union type
Allows a variable to store more than one data type.

Example:
let id: number | string;
id = 101;
id = "EMP101";

void
Used for functions that do not return any value.

Example:
function logMessage(): void {
console.log("Hello TypeScript");
}

NON-PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES

Non-primitive data types are used to store complex values such as objects, arrays, and functions.
