Day 1 – TypeScript for Playwright

Date: 31/1/2026

Topics Covered:

1. Difference between JavaScript and TypeScript
- JavaScript is dynamically typed.
- TypeScript is statically typed.
- TypeScript helps catch errors during development before execution.
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.

2. How TypeScript Works
- TypeScript code cannot be executed directly by the browser or Node.js.
- TypeScript code is first compiled into JavaScript.
- The generated JavaScript code is then executed by Node.js or the browser.

Flow:
TypeScript (.ts) → TypeScript Compiler (tsc) → JavaScript (.js) → Execution

3. Type Safety
- Type safety ensures variables hold values of a specific type.
- Helps reduce runtime errors and improves code reliability.

Example:
let age: number = 25;
age = 30;        // Valid
age = "twenty"; // Invalid in TypeScript

4. Installation of TypeScript Compiler
Command used to install TypeScript globally:
npm install -g typescript

Command to check TypeScript version:
tsc --version

5. Converting TypeScript Code into JavaScript
Command:
tsc firstdemo.ts

- This command generates a JavaScript file.
- The JavaScript file is executed using Node.js.

Execution command:
node firstdemo.js

6. TypeScript Executor (ts-node)
- ts-node allows execution of TypeScript files directly.
- No need to manually convert TypeScript to JavaScript.

Installation:
npm install -D ts-node

Execution:
npx ts-node firstdemo.ts

7. Summary
- Learned the difference between JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Understood how TypeScript works internally.
- Learned about type safety and its importance.
- Installed TypeScript compiler.
- Learned two ways to execute TypeScript code:
  1. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript and run it.
  2. Execute TypeScript directly using ts-node.
