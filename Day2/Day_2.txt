TOPIC: COMMENTS AND VARIABLES IN TYPESCRIPT

COMMENTS IN TYPESCRIPT

Comments are used to explain the code. They are ignored by the TypeScript compiler.

Types of Comments:

Single-line Comment
// This is a single-line comment

Multi-line Comment
/*
This is a multi-line comment
Used for more than one line
*/

VARIABLE IN TYPESCRIPT

A variable is used to store data values so that the data can be reused and modified in a program.

Example:
let age = 21;

KEYWORD IN TYPESCRIPT

A keyword is a reserved word in TypeScript that has a predefined meaning and cannot be used as a variable name.

Examples of keywords:
var, let, const, if, else, function, return

SYNTAX OF VARIABLE DECLARATION IN TYPESCRIPT

var variableName = value;
let variableName = value;
const variableName = value;

VARIABLE KEYWORDS IN TYPESCRIPT

TypeScript provides three keywords to declare variables:

var

let

const

SCOPE IN TYPESCRIPT

Scope defines where a variable can be accessed.

There are two types of scope in TypeScript:

Function Scope
Variables declared using var have function scope.
They can be accessed anywhere inside the function.

Example:
function demo() {
var x = 10;
}

Block Scope
Variables declared using let and const have block scope.
They can be accessed only inside the block.

Example:
if (true) {
let y = 20;
const z = 30;
}

DECLARATION AND VALUE ASSIGNMENT

var can be declared without initialization.
let can be declared without initialization.
const must be initialized at the time of declaration.

Example:
var a;
let b;
const c = 10;

RE-DECLARATION

var allows re-declaration of the same variable.
let does not allow re-declaration.
const does not allow re-declaration.

Example:
var x = 10;
var x = 20;

let y = 10;
let y = 20; (Error)

const z = 30;
const z = 40; (Error)

RE-INITIALIZATION / RE-ASSIGNMENT

var allows re-assignment.
let allows re-assignment.
const does not allow re-assignment because it is constant.

Example:
var a = 1;
a = 2;

let b = 3;
b = 4;

const c = 5;
c = 6; (Error)

HOISTING

Hoisting means variables are moved to the top of their scope before execution.

var is hoisted and initialized with undefined.
let and const are hoisted but not initialized and give an error if accessed before declaration.

Example:

console.log(x);
var x = 10;

console.log(y);
let y = 20; (Error)

console.log(z);
const z = 30; (Error)
